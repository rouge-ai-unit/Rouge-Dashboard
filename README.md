## Getting Started

### Quick Production Setup (Recommended)

1. **Set your API keys** in `.env.local` or `.env`:
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
   DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your-deepseek-api-key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   ```

2. **Run the automated setup**:
   ```bash
   npm run setup:prod
   ```

   This will automatically:
   - ‚úÖ Check all required environment variables
   - üê≥ Start Redis Docker container
   - ‚öôÔ∏è Start the background worker
   - üåê Start the Next.js application
   - üìä Dashboard available at http://localhost:3000

### Manual Setup

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Set up your `.env.local` (see `.env.example`)
3. Set up database: `npm run db`
4. Start Redis: `npm run redis:start`
5. Start worker: `npm run worker:agritech`
6. Run dev server: `npm run dev`
7. Build for production: `npm run build` then `npm start`

### Available Scripts

- `npm run setup:prod` - Complete automated production setup
- `npm run start:all` - Start all services manually
- `npm run redis:start` - Start Redis Docker container
- `npm run worker:agritech` - Start background worker
- `npm run db` - Push database schema
- `npm run db:studio` - Open Drizzle Studio

## Production Checklist

1. Set all required envs (see above).
2. Run a clean build: `npm run build` and `npm start`.
3. Test all main pages and APIs.
4. Confirm ticketing, notifications, and AI features work as expected.

## Getting started

- Install deps
```powershell
npm install
```

- Run dev server
```powershell
npm run dev
```

- Database setup (Drizzle + Neon)
	- Define schema in `utils/schema.tsx`
	- Ensure `DATABASE_URL` is set
	- Push schema
```powershell
npm run db
```

- Drizzle Studio
```powershell
npm run db:studio
```

- Build & start
```powershell
npm run build
npm start
```

If you see SWC warnings on Windows but build succeeds, ensure 64-bit Node 20+, then reinstall dependencies if needed.

## Production checklist

1) Set all required envs: DATABASE_URL, NEXTAUTH_URL, NEXTAUTH_SECRET, GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID/SECRET (or keep credentials provider), ALLOWED_* as needed.
2) Optional: GA4_PROPERTY_ID and GA_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_PATH if using /api/analytics; NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI for server-side generation.
3) Disable dev bypass: ensure NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_AUTH is not set.
4) Run a clean build: `npm run build`. Start with `npm start`.
5) Verify APIs (200s): /api/tools, /api/tickets, /api/tracker, /api/contents, /api/analytics (if configured).
6) Confirm Tools dashboard shows the discovered defaults or DB-backed entries.

## Authentication behavior

- Providers
	- Uses Google if GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID/SECRET are present
	- Credentials provider is enabled in development; in production set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_EMAIL_AUTH=true` to allow it
- Allowlist
	- If ALLOWED_* is not configured, any authenticated user can sign in. ‚Äú.rouge@gmail.com‚Äù emails are explicitly allowed.
	- Otherwise, allow by specific emails, domains, or patterns (see `lib/auth.ts`).
- Bypass in dev
	- `NODE_ENV=development` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_AUTH=true` allows everything
- Middleware
	- `app/(route)/layout.tsx` renders `Topbar` (Suspense wrapped) and guards access to route group with middleware

## API endpoints (protected)

All write operations require a session; in development, the bypass allows local testing without OAuth.

- Companies: `/api/companies`
	- GET ‚Äî list companies
	- POST ‚Äî create
	- In dev without DB vars, uses in-memory storage
- Contents: `/api/contents`
	- GET ‚Äî list entries
	- POST ‚Äî create
	- In dev without DB vars, uses in-memory storage
- Tickets: `/api/tickets`
	- GET ‚Äî list tickets
	- POST ‚Äî create; optional Slack notification if `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` set
- Tools: `/api/tools`
	- GET ‚Äî list tools (public, returns discovered defaults when DB is empty)
	- POST ‚Äî create (persists only columns present in DB schema)
- Work Tracker: `/api/tracker`
	- GET ‚Äî query with filters q, unit, status; sort; pagination page/pageSize (dev memory or DB)
	- POST ‚Äî create item
	- `/api/tracker/[id]`: PUT, PATCH, DELETE for updates/removal
- Link preview: `/api/link-preview?url=...` ‚Äî extracts og:title/description/image with timeout
- Article excerpt: `/api/article?url=...&max=1200` ‚Äî extracts safe excerpt, site meta, word count (no full content)

## UI highlights

- `components/Dashboard.tsx`
	- Displays Tools and Tickets, polling refresh
	- Ticket creation form with validations, draft persistence to localStorage, CSV export
- `app/(route)/work-tracker/page.tsx`
	- Rich table with search, filters, sort, resize, pagination, polling, and edit dialogs
- `app/(route)/tools/agtech-company-automation/page.tsx`
	- Generate Companies via Gemini, persist with `/api/companies`, analyze selected company via Gemini
- `app/(route)/tools/ai-news-daily`
	- `page.tsx`: Fetches daily news list (Google Apps Script), caches to localStorage, previews OG images
	- `[id]/page.tsx`: Detail view with Suspense-wrapped `useSearchParams`, preview image, reader excerpt, summary, and share/copy

## Drizzle schema (summary)

- Companies `companyDetails`: companyName, region, contacts, booleans for mailing list states
- LinkedinContent `linkedinContent`: planning calendar fields
- WorkTracker `workTracker`: unit/task/assignee/status/dates/update
- Tools `tools`: cards for dashboard modules
- Tickets `tickets`: structured request data fields

See `utils/schema.tsx` for column details.

## Development tips

- Shell integration: enable VS Code‚Äôs PowerShell shell integration to get command detection and output navigation
	- Add to `$PROFILE`:
```powershell
if ($env:TERM_PROGRAM -eq "vscode") { . "$(code --locate-shell-integration-path pwsh)" }
```
- Fix SWC Windows warning: install 64-bit Node 20+, clear node_modules and reinstall
- Suspense requirements: client pages using `useSearchParams` should be wrapped in `<Suspense>` (we already did for AI News detail and Topbar)

## Troubleshooting

- UNAUTHORIZED in APIs locally: set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_AUTH=true` or sign in via Google with an allowed email
- DATABASE_URL not set: APIs will fall back to in-memory arrays for local dev; set Postgres URL for persistence
- Link preview/article fetches fail: remote sites may block bots; try again or provide alternate URLs

## Analytics & Reporting

This project supports two analytics paths: a GA4 realtime API endpoint and an embedded Looker Studio report.

- GA4 Realtime API
	- Endpoint: `GET /api/analytics`
	- Reads `GA4_PROPERTY_ID` from environment. There is a hardcoded fallback (`452314459`) for local dev, but you still need credentials.
	- Credentials: Service account JSON file at `config/google-analytics-service.json` with scope `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics.readonly`.
	- Response: Raw response from Analytics Data API v1beta `properties.runRealtimeReport` with `dimensions: country` and `metrics: activeUsers`.
	- Failure behavior: If credentials/property are misconfigured, the API returns `{ users: 0, error: "analytics unavailable" }` with HTTP 200 to avoid front-end crashes.

- Looker Studio Embed
	- Component: `components/LookerEmbed.tsx`
	- Replace the `src` URL with your own Looker Studio report. The iframe allows fullscreen and is sandboxed appropriately.

GA4 setup steps

1) Create a GA4 property and note its Property ID (Admin ‚Üí Property Settings). Set `GA4_PROPERTY_ID` in your environment.
2) In Google Cloud Console, create a Service Account (or reuse one) and enable the ‚ÄúGoogle Analytics Data API‚Äù.
3) Generate a JSON key for the service account and save it locally as `config/google-analytics-service.json`.
4) In GA4 Admin ‚Üí Property Access Management, grant the service account email Viewer/Analyst access to the property.
5) Do not commit the key. It‚Äôs ignored by `.gitignore` (see `/config/google-analytics-service.json`). For deployment, mount or provision the key file at the same path.

Notes

- You may also choose to store a web analytics tag separately via `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID` (client-side), which is optional and independent from the server-side GA4 Data API.
- If you change the metrics/dimensions in `lib/ga.ts`, ensure the front-end consumer understands the new response shape.
